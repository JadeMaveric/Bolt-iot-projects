# Bolt-iot-projects
This is a playground repo. Where I save test code, and other simple projects built on Inventrom's Bolt. Do clone, modifiy and share the code here! :)
## Repo structure
Most of the projects are browser based, so I thought it would be convenient to host them on the project website [https://jademaveric.github.com/Bolt-iot-projects].  
So all complete projects also reside in the gh-pages repo.
